    Named distinctly from ``engine.board_renderer.BoardRenderer`` (which
    returns a rendered string from a bare ``AbstractBoard``) rather than
    implementing that interface — this renderer needs the full snapshot
    and produces pixels as a side effect, not a string.

    Takes a ``GameSnapshot`` rather than a live ``GameState`` — the UI
    layer only ever reads a frozen, point-in-time view (see
    ``engine.snapshot``), never the engine's mutable internals.

    Owns one ``PieceView`` per occupied cell, kept in ``_piece_views``
    across calls (rebuilt, not recreated, each ``render()`` — see
    ``_sync_piece_views``) so each piece's ``PieceStateMachine`` keeps
    its animation timing between frames rather than restarting at frame
    0 on every render.
