"""
Unit tests for advanced Pawn rules wired through GameEngine:

  1. A Pawn may move two cells forward from its start row.
  2. The path (the single intermediate square) must be clear.
  3. A Pawn that reaches the back rank is promoted to a Queen.

Rule-level coverage (PawnRule.is_valid_shape / is_valid_with_context /
requires_path_check / is_valid_with_board, and MoveValidator integration)
lives in test_rules.py. This file exercises the same features end-to-end
through handle_click()/tick(), including the promotion side effect that
only GameEngine performs (via AbstractBoard.set_piece_at).
